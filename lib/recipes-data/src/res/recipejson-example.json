Toss the dressing through the salad and season to taste; it may need more lime juice. Scatter the sesame seeds on top and serve.</p> \n<p><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></p> \n<p>So long as it’s undressed and covered, the salad will keep in the crisper drawer for a few days. The dressing works well on all sorts of veg, from strips of red pepper to bean sprouts or sliced crisp turnips. And if you want to add a meaty element, toss through some hot griddled strips of beef or pork tenderloin.</p>"
